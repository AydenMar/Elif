<h2>Description</h2>
Engineer and direct recording sessions of various voice over artists/actors. Assist with real time translations and audio editing as well as full session syncing of recorded audio to various foreign shows.

Handle synced audio into a full mix session using Protools as my main DAW. As a mixer I add perspective to sounds according to the foreign video as well as clean audio from noise other recording disturbances using Izotope RX and add further spacial effects such as reverb and delay to creatively mix the dubbed audio to further match the foreign video files used. Once the mixes are completed, I ensure and curate client requested changes and get the mixes ready for media distribution.
